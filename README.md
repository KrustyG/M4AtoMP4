M4S Network Monitor is a browser extension that identifies and lists `.m4s` media segments from streaming services. It helps users track `.m4s` files, displaying their URLs conveniently for download or conversion.


## Installing the M4S Network Monitor Extension

Follow these steps to install the extension from the `M4StoMP4.rar` archive:

### Step 1: Extract the Archive
- Download the `M4StoMP4.rar` file listed above.
- Locate the `M4StoMP4.rar` file.
- Use an extraction tool (such as **WinRAR**, **7-Zip**, or **The Unarchiver**) to extract the contents of `M4StoMP4.rar`.
- Extract it to a folder of your choice. This will give you a folder named `M4StoMP4` or similar, containing the extension files (e.g., `manifest.json`, JavaScript files, etc.).

### Step 2: Open Chrome or Opera Extensions Page
- Open **Google Chrome or Opera**.
- In the address bar, type: `chrome://extensions/` and press **Enter**.
- Enable **Developer mode** by toggling the switch in the top-right corner.

### Step 3: Load the Unpacked Extension
- Click the **Load unpacked** button that appears once Developer mode is enabled.
- Navigate to the folder where you extracted `M4StoMP4.rar`.
- Select the folder that contains the extension files.

### Step 4: Confirm Installation
- Once you select the folder, Chrome will load the extension, and it should appear in your list of installed extensions.
- You may now see the extension icon in the browser toolbar, and it's ready for use.

**Note**: The extension will function only when the popup is open, and no data is transmitted to any external server.

### Troubleshooting
- Make sure that all necessary files are present in the extracted folder (`manifest.json`, JavaScript files, HTML, etc.).
- If you encounter issues, try re-extracting the `M4StoMP4.rar` file to ensure no files were corrupted during the extraction process.
